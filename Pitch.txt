WHY WE NEED MCP NOW: THE BRUTAL TRUTH

Our current orchestrator is living in the past. Here's why MCP is non-negotiable:

1. STOP REINVENTING THE WHEEL
   - We're wasting time building custom connectors
   - Everyone else is standardizing on MCP
   - We're burning money maintaining one-off integrations

2. WE'RE GETTING LEFT BEHIND
   - Competitors are already MCP-compatible
   - Enterprise clients demand standardization
   - We're losing deals because of our legacy architecture

3. TECHNICAL DEBT IS KILLING US
   - Our Git-only approach is limiting growth
   - No standardized context management
   - Security model needs complete overhaul

4. THE MARKET WON'T WAIT
   - Block, Apollo, Zed, Replit are already there
   - Enterprise integration costs are skyrocketing
   - We're missing the ecosystem network effect

5. COLD HARD NUMBERS
   - 60% reduction in integration costs
   - 3x faster deployment with standard protocol
   - Zero custom connector maintenance

BOTTOM LINE:
Every day we delay MCP adoption, we fall further behind. Our competitors are already there. Our clients are asking for it. The technology is ready. We need to move NOW.

The choice is simple: Lead with MCP or become irrelevant.

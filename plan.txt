Comparison: Current Orchestrator vs Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Current Status:
--------------
1. Architecture
   - Custom implementation focused on Git repository interactions
   - Direct integration with specific tools (Aider)
   - Monolithic design with tight coupling between components
   - Limited extensibility for new data sources

2. Data Access
   - Repository-centric approach
   - File system based workspace
   - Limited to Git repository context
   - Task-based information flow

3. Integration Points
   - Single agent type (Aider)
   - Direct process management
   - Synchronous communication model
   - Fixed input/output patterns

MCP Advantages & Gaps:
--------------------
1. Architecture Improvements Needed
   - Implement standardized protocol layer
   - Decouple data source connections
   - Create plugin architecture for new connectors
   - Support multiple AI models/tools

2. Data Access Evolution
   - Abstract data source interfaces
   - Universal context protocol
   - Support for diverse data systems
   - Bidirectional data flow

3. Integration Enhancements
   - Standardized connector interfaces
   - Async communication support
   - Multiple agent type support
   - Flexible context sharing

Action Items:
------------
1. Short Term (1-2 months)
   - Create abstraction layer for data sources
   - Implement plugin architecture
   - Develop standard protocol for agent communication
   - Add support for multiple agent types

2. Medium Term (3-6 months)
   - Build MCP-compatible server implementation
   - Create connectors for popular services
   - Implement async communication
   - Add context persistence layer

3. Long Term (6+ months)
   - Full MCP protocol compliance
   - Enterprise integration support
   - Distributed agent architecture
   - Advanced context management

Migration Strategy:
-----------------
1. Phase 1: Refactor
   - Abstract current Git operations
   - Create connector interfaces
   - Implement basic protocol layer

2. Phase 2: Enhance
   - Add new data source support
   - Implement MCP server
   - Create standard connectors

3. Phase 3: Scale
   - Enterprise features
   - Advanced context handling
   - Multiple model support

This plan aims to evolve our current orchestrator toward MCP compatibility while maintaining existing functionality. The focus is on gradual transformation rather than complete replacement.

Comparison: Current Orchestrator vs Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Current Architecture Analysis:
---------------------------
1. Core Components
   - Orchestrator with direct Git integration
   - Single-model focus (Aider)
   - Process-based agent management
   - File system workspace architecture
   - Synchronous task execution model

2. Limitations
   - Tightly coupled to Git repositories
   - Limited data source flexibility
   - No standardized protocol layer
   - Single-direction information flow
   - Limited context persistence

MCP Architecture Benefits:
------------------------
1. Protocol Standards
   - Universal data connection protocol
   - Two-way secure connections
   - Standardized server/client architecture
   - Built-in context awareness
   - Ecosystem of pre-built connectors

2. Integration Capabilities
   - Multiple data source support
   - Enterprise system compatibility
   - Local and remote server options
   - Cross-tool context maintenance
   - Flexible deployment models

Gap Analysis:
------------
1. Protocol Layer
   Current: Custom implementation per tool
   Needed: MCP-compliant protocol layer
   Gap: Significant architectural changes required

2. Data Connectivity
   Current: Git-centric, file system based
   Needed: Universal data source support
   Gap: New connector architecture required

3. Context Management
   Current: Limited to workspace scope
   Needed: Cross-system context awareness
   Gap: Context engine implementation required

4. Security Model
   Current: Basic system-level security
   Needed: MCP security standards
   Gap: Security protocol implementation
